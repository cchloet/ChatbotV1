# ChatbotV1

This is the first iteration of a chatbot built from the ground up using the chatterbot library. The chatbot currently cannot hold up a continuous conversation, but if the prompt is within the training data set, the model will respond with the recorded correct response. There are several logic adapters commented out in the model. At the moment, all 4 adapters do not work together, but work individually as the sole logic adapter. Below are some pictures to demonstrate the level of conversation the model is at.
